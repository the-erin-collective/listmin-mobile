# listmin-mobile

listmin-mobile is the mobile client for listmin, a listing platform for minimum wage pegged goods and services and is built with NativeScript.

the listmin server code can be found here:  
[listmin](https://github.com/the-erin-collective/listmin)

## Setup

### Dependencies

NativeScript can be setup using [this guide](https://docs.nativescript.org/environment-setup.html), follow the android setup process for your operating system.

note: there may be trouble getting the nativescript cli to find your jdk path, trying jdk1.8.0_152 and pointing to that installed folder in the %JAVA_HOME% path variable may resolve it.

### Installation

The NativeScript cli installed before is used to start the app using ```ns run android```

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/the-erin-collective/listmin-mobile.git
$ cd listmin-mobile

# install packages
$ npm install

# start the app
$ ns run android
```
